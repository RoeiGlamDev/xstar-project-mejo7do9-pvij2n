Here's a `tsconfig.json` file tailored for a React/TypeScript project, which you can use for your luxury dark AirBNB website named HouseIL. This configuration is set up to support modern JavaScript features and React development.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
}
```

### Explanation of Key Options:
- **target**: Specifies the ECMAScript target version. `es6` is a good choice for modern applications.
- **module**: Sets the module system. `commonjs` is commonly used in Node.js environments.
- **lib**: Includes the necessary libraries for DOM manipulation and modern JavaScript features.
- **strict**: Enables all strict type-checking options.
- **jsx**: Specifies the JSX code generation. `react-jsx` is used for React 17 and above.
- **baseUrl** and **paths**: Helps in setting up absolute imports, making it easier to manage imports in your project.

You can place this `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project directory. Make sure to adjust any paths or settings according to your specific project structure and requirements.

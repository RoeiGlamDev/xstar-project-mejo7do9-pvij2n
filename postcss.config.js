Certainly! Below is a sample `postcss.config.js` file that you can use for your luxury dark AirBNB website named HouseIL. This configuration includes some common PostCSS plugins that can help you with your styling needs.

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('postcss-import'), // Allows you to use @import in your CSS
    require('tailwindcss'), // If you're using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
    require('autoprefixer'), // Adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules
    require('cssnano')({ preset: 'default' }), // Minifies your CSS for production
  ],
};
```

### Explanation of the Plugins:
- **postcss-import**: This plugin allows you to use `@import` statements in your CSS files, making it easier to manage styles across multiple files.
- **tailwindcss**: If you decide to use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, this plugin will help you integrate it into your project.
- **autoprefixer**: This plugin automatically adds vendor prefixes to your CSS rules, ensuring better browser compatibility.
- **cssnano**: This plugin minifies your CSS for production, helping to reduce file size and improve load times.

Make sure to install the necessary packages if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install postcss postcss-import tailwindcss autoprefixer cssnano --save-dev
```

You can customize the configuration further based on your specific needs and design preferences.

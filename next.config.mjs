Here's a `next.config.mjs` file tailored for your luxury dark Airbnb website named HouseIL, with an elegant design in pink and black colors. This configuration includes some common settings that you might want to consider for a Next.js application.

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'next';

export default defineConfig({
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  images: {
    domains: ['example.com'], // Add your image domains here
  },
  experimental: {
    appDir: true, // Enable the app directory feature if you're using it
  },
  webpack(config) {
    // Custom webpack configuration can go here
    return config;
  },
  env: {
    // Add any environment variables you need
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  },
});
```

### Explanation:
- **reactStrictMode**: Enables React's Strict Mode for highlighting potential problems in your application.
- **swcMinify**: Uses SWC for minifying your JavaScript, which can improve build performance.
- **images**: Configures allowed image domains for the Next.js Image component.
- **experimental**: Enables experimental features like the app directory if you're using it.
- **webpack**: Allows you to customize the Webpack configuration if needed.
- **env**: Allows you to define environment variables that can be accessed in your application.

Make sure to replace `'example.com'` with the actual domains from which you will be serving images, and set any necessary environment variables in your `.env` file.

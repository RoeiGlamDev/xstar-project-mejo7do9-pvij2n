Certainly! Below is a sample implementation of an `InteractiveModel.tsx` component for a luxury dark AirBNB website named HouseIL. This component uses React and TypeScript, and is designed to display a 3D interactive model. For simplicity, I'll use a placeholder for the 3D model rendering logic, which you can replace with your actual 3D rendering library (like Three.js or React Three Fiber).

// components/3d/InteractiveModel.tsx

import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';

const InteractiveModel: React.FC = () => {
  const modelRef = useRef<THREE.Group>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Any additional setup or animations can be added here
  }, []);

  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100vh', backgroundColor: '#1a1a1a', padding: '20px' }}>
      <Canvas>
        <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
        <directionalLight position={[10, 10, 5]} intensity={1} />
        <OrbitControls />
        {/* Replace the following mesh with your actual 3D model */}
        <mesh ref={modelRef}>
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color="#ff69b4" />
        </mesh>
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
};

export default InteractiveModel;

### Explanation:
- **Imports**: The component imports necessary modules from React, React Three Fiber, and Drei for 3D rendering.
- **Canvas**: The `Canvas` component from React Three Fiber is used to create a 3D rendering context.
- **Lighting**: Ambient and directional lights are added to illuminate the scene.
- **OrbitControls**: This allows users to interact with the model by rotating, zooming, and panning.
- **Placeholder Model**: A simple box geometry is used as a placeholder. You can replace this with your actual 3D model by importing it and using the appropriate component.

### Styling:
- The background color is set to a dark shade (`#1a1a1a`) to match the luxury theme, and the model color is set to pink (`#ff69b4`).

Make sure to install the necessary packages if you haven't already:

npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei three

Feel free to customize the component further to fit your design needs!

Certainly! Below is a sample implementation of a `Scene3D` component in TypeScript for a luxury dark AirBNB website named HouseIL. This component uses the `react-three-fiber` library to create a 3D scene. Make sure to install the necessary dependencies if you haven't already.

// components/3d/Scene3D.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';

const Scene3D: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas
      style={{ height: '100vh', background: 'black' }}
      camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 50 }}
    >
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} intensity={1} color="pink" />
      <OrbitControls />
      {/* Add your 3D models or elements here */}
      <mesh>
        <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
        <meshStandardMaterial color="pink" />
      </mesh>
    </Canvas>
  );
};

export default Scene3D;

### Explanation:
- **Imports**: The component imports necessary modules from React and `react-three-fiber`, as well as `OrbitControls` from `@react-three/drei` for interactive camera controls.
- **Canvas**: The `Canvas` component sets up the 3D rendering context. The background is set to black to match the luxury theme.
- **Lighting**: Ambient and point lights are added to illuminate the scene, with the point light colored pink to align with the design theme.
- **3D Elements**: A simple box mesh is included as a placeholder. You can replace this with your own 3D models or elements as needed.

### Usage:
To use this component, simply import and include it in your main application or any other component:

import Scene3D from './components/3d/Scene3D';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 style={{ color: 'pink' }}>Welcome to HouseIL</h1>
      <Scene3D />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

Make sure to customize the 3D elements and styles further to fit the luxurious aesthetic you are aiming for!

Here's a TypeScript file named `types/three.ts` for your `threetypes` component in a luxury dark AirBNB website named HouseIL. This file defines types that you might use in your React components.

```typescript
// types/three.ts

import React from 'react';

// Define a type for the property listing
export interface Property {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  pricePerNight: number;
  imageUrl: string;
  location: string;
  amenities: string[];
  rating: number;
}

// Define a type for the booking information
export interface Booking {
  propertyId: string;
  checkInDate: Date;
  checkOutDate: Date;
  guests: number;
}

// Define a type for the user profile
export interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  profilePictureUrl?: string;
  favoriteProperties: string[]; // Array of property IDs
}

// Define a type for the context that will hold global state
export interface AppContextType {
  properties: Property[];
  user: UserProfile | null;
  bookings: Booking[];
  addProperty: (property: Property) => void;
  removeProperty: (propertyId: string) => void;
  addBooking: (booking: Booking) => void;
  removeBooking: (bookingId: string) => void;
}

// Create a context for the app
export const AppContext = React.createContext<AppContextType | undefined>(undefined);
```

This file includes interfaces for properties, bookings, user profiles, and the application context, which can be used throughout your React components to ensure type safety and clarity. Adjust the properties and methods as needed to fit your specific application requirements.
